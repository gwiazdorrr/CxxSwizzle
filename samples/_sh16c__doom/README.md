# `[SH16C] Doom` by `P_Malin`: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lldGDr

This shadertoy comes with automated trivial fixes applied only - it uses lots of arrays and syntax GLSL for these is fundamentally incompatible with C++. Sadly it will not compile in SIMD mode - non-scalar indexing operators for arrays are not supported yet.
