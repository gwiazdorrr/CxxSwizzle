// This header contains functions that are proxies to vector static functions. Vector
// type common for all the arguments is chosen based on ::swizzle::detail::get_vector_type,
// which relies on ::swizzle::detail::get_vector_type_impl specialisations. This is a solution
// to a few problems:
// - if the vector type of size 1 is implicitly constructible from a scalar these functions
//   will work, even if called with scalars only
// - gets rid of ambiguity, provided vector's static functions are not ambiguous 
// - can decay result of the static functions ( vec1 -> scalar ); in here the assumption
//   is that the result is convertible to the decay type
//
// You should include this file *in the namespace* you are going to use CxxSwizzle. 
// The reason is standard headers sneakily include <math.h>, which in turn pollutes
// global namespace with functions such as sin and cos. Due to the way ADL works,
// all calls with scalars only be matched against these global functions first.
// That is usually not a problem, but they might give different results then
// shader language's you are trying to emulate.
// Only defining functions of same name in a namespace overrides this behavior
// (importing with using statement doesn't), giving you full control of how scalars
// are handled.
//
// Another "funny" thing: the bit in the decltype is different to the one in return statement;
// Both are meant to call static functions. In C++ it is legal to call a static function
// like a member function, i.e. using an instance. This form is used in the decltype as
// it yields better error messages in MSVC if something goes wrong (can't specialize vs.
// internal complier linkage).
